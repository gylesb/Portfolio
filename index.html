              <h4>I am currently a 23 year old student who is attending a programming school called <em>Epicodus</em>. Other than that I guess you can call me your average guy. There is much more to me than meets the eye though.</h4>

              <h2><strong>My Background</strong></h2>
              <h4>What background do I have that is relevant to this course work? Quite honestly almost nothing that I've done before has prepared me for the difficulty that this holds. I do know that if I am motivated to do something - <em>and trust me, I really am</em> - I'll do it to the best of my abilities. I think my only experience in HTML is creating the most basic stuff in 8th grade for a project. Other than that, technology in general has played a pretty big role in my life from a young age. I even took a break straight out of high school in order to pursue a profession in video games by playing a few titles of <span class="cod">Call of Duty</span> on a professional level. While that didn't pan out, it did make me realize what I wanted to do as a career.</h4>
